                    This command reminds you to look away from your screen every 20 min, following 
                    the 20-20-20 rule for eye strain. The command +eyes starts the eye strain reduction session, 
                    and calling the command again while a session is ongoing will cancel it. The reminders are 
                    sent directly to the user who requested the Studdy Buddy via their direct message inbox. 
                    To learn more about the 20-20-20 rule and its benefits to your health, watch <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GxXIftBUA0&>this video</a> made by the Canadian Association of Optometrists.

                    The pomodoro technique is a method designed to increase productivity and manage time. It involves work periods of 25 minutes each, followed by a 5 minute break. Every fifth work period is 30 minutes.  
                    Once called, the Study Buddy Bot will send you a direct message at the end of each work period to 
                    let you know when you should take a break, as well as letting you know when you should get back to
                    work. Use the comman +pomodoro to begin this session, or end any ongoing sessions.

                    Everyone loves playing video games, but sometimes we can get a little carried away. To ensure you are staying healthy while having fun, 
                    the Study Buddy Bot allows you to start gaming sessions. The session begins by typing the command +gaming, and will send you a direct 
                    message every hour reminding you to take a break from the games. When you are done playing, simply re-type the command +gaming to end your session.
