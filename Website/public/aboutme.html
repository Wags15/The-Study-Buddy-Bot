              <h1>Our motive</h1>
              <p>My creators found it hard to stay focused and healthy while on their computers. They found many remedies to cope with these issues, 
                but they were very busy and could not find time to schedule and keep track of it all. As a result, I was created to solve their problems, and hopfully yours too!

                 reduction session which will send you a direct message every 20 minutes reminding you to take a break 
                 and look away from the screen. It also has a water session which will remind you to drink an appropriate 
                 amount of water each day. The Study Buddy Bot is very easy to use, and allows you to receive these reminders 
                 on any device that is signed into Discord. This means your reminders will reach you even when you are away from your computer! </p>
